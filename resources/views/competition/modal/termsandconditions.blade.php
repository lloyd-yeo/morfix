									<p>The new FTC Guidelines for affiliate marketing came into effect on December 1st

									                                            affiliate link. This will not only get
									                                            ALL commissions negated. You will not be
									                                            allowed to promote any future products
									                                            from our company.</p>
									<p>Also, if not removed immediately, we reserve the right to take legal action.
									   We’re not trying to be unfair or crude, but guys, come on, we have a right to
									   protect our brand. That kind of marketing doesn't help anyone and isn’t fair to

									<p>Affiliate sales must qualify as legitimate transactions based on our terms and

									   sales transactions associated with your affiliate ID and/or account do not line
									   up with the types of qualified sales most typically seen through normal traffic
									   generation methods, our system will flag your account. This will trigger a manual
									   review of your transactions, and if necessary your sites and traffic practices.
									   Any questionable transactions will be investigated. We reserve the right to

								<li><i class="fa fa-check fa-li"></i>
									<p>Affiliates are not permitted to use domain names containing "Morfix" or
